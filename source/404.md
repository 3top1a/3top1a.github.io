Anyway, since you probably need to pass the time, here's my complete recipe for hot cocoa!

Get a small sauce pan. You'll want to add the ingredients, but first: add a bit of salt.
Then put in the cocoa. If you have sweetened cocoa, such as from a supermarket, add about 2 tablespoons. If not, mix the cocoa and sugar to your liking.
Now for the secret - vanilla sugar. Add anywhere between 5g to 10g and stir.
Mix in 2 cups of milk. I use common cow milk, but use whatever you want (like I'm going to stop you).
Put it on medium heat and stir until mixed and hot (**not bubbles hot!**), it should have a solid brown color.
Now just serve in a glass, preferably with a cookie or two, and enjoy!
