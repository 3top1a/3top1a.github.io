## I like it suckless

This website is explicitly built to be as simple and fast as possible.
No JavaScript, no [complicated frameworks](https://reactjs.org/) or a 4K image that is hidden anyway, just good ol’ HTML and CSS.
I’m also a believer in the [Suckless philosophy](https://suckless.org/philosophy/) - no software should be more complicated than it needs to be.
I absolutely hate slow, bloated websites that shove ads down your throat like an endoscope and require you to click "no" 50 times just to then *autoplay a video ad*.
Since the [favicon](logo_s.ico) isn't going to be bigger than 20 pixels on anyone's screen, it's just 246 **bytes**.

This page is built with the most basic HTML5 and CSS tags, so you and your browser knows what is in this site.
Hell, load this page in IE6, ***I dare you***.
